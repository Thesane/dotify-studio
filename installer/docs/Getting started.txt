Getting started with Easy Embossing Utility, release 2010-09-27 Beta

The software starts automatically when clicking on a PEF-file. Before you can emboss a file for the first time, the embosser has to be configured. Use one of the embosser test files supplied with the software and follow the setup instructions.

In order to use all features of the preview mode, one of the following fonts must be installed on the system:

http://code2000.net/CODE2000.ZIP

Note that Code2000 is the only font that supports all 256 braille patterns.

To uninstall, locate "Uninstall" in the Windows start menu. Note that this will not uninstall plugins or fonts.
