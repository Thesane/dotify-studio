Getting started with Easy Embossing Utility

The software starts automatically when clicking on a PEF-file. Before you can emboss a file for the first time, the embosser has to be configured. Use one of the embosser test files supplied with the software and follow the setup instructions.

To uninstall, locate "Uninstall" in the Windows start menu. Note that this will not uninstall plugins or fonts.

== Linux/Mac ==
Run the software by double clicking the e2u.jar file. Open a file through the "Open" tab.
